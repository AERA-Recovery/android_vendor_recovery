# AERA Soong build-variable bridge
#
# Soong (the .go *_defaults under bootable/recovery) reads legacy recovery feature
# flags through getMakeVars(), i.e. the "twrpVarsPlugin" SOONG_CONFIG namespace.
# Soong cannot see plain Make variables, so a flag set as "OF_FOO := 1" in a
# device tree .mk only reaches Soong if it is exported into that namespace here.
#
# This list lives in vendor/recovery (AERA-owned) rather than in
# vendor/twrp/config/BoardConfigSoong.mk so that the upstream TWRP config stays
# untouched. It is included from build/make/core/config.mk, right after
# BoardConfigTWRP.mk (which creates the twrpVarsPlugin namespace and runs after
# the device BoardConfig, so the OF_* values are already set by the time we read
# them below).

# Some settings flags remain AERA_*-prefixed for compatibility: AERA_A16.sh and the
# installer (installer/META-INF/com/google/android/update-binary) read them as
# AERA_* at build/flash time, so the AERA_* name must be left intact. Soong,
# however, reads them under OF_*. Mirror the AERA_* value onto OF_* (only when
# OF_* isn't already set) so a build that sets the documented AERA_* name still
# reaches Soong. This is NOT a deprecation: AERA_* remains the primary name for
# these vars.
